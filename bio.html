        I started to code at age 11 with basic forays into web development; I learned the basics of HTML from my father and put together some basic websites locally using OpenOffice. 
        At age 12, I took my first step into imperative programming with 
        <a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com/?m=view_product&amp;id=2030&amp;page=index">Dark Basic Classic</a>, then called Dark Basic. 
        The simple, readable syntax was enough to set me off developing games, a hobby that I have continued to this day. 
        By seventh grade, I had intuited the standard "game loop" design framework, and 
        used it to develop several fledgling projects in the newer Dark Basic Pro. I rarely delved deeply into projects, preferring to experiment
        with new ideas instead of developing old ones.

        As I entered High School, I began to develop networked multiplayer games to play with my friends on the school's LAN.

        Sophomore year, I began taking classes in Computer Programming, and was introduced to my first Object-Oriented Language, Java. 
        </p><p>
        As a senior in high school, I embarked on a guided study on iOS development. 
        </p><p>
        First semester of freshman year, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/15/">Data Structures</a>, and learned C++ in the process. 
        The next semester, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40">Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming</a>, a class for which I, over the course of two semesters, was a teaching assistant. I also took Discrete Mathematics. 
        </p><p>
        As a first-semester sophomore, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150IDS">Internet Scale Distributed Systems</a>, a special topics course taught by the IETF's own 
        <a href="http://www.arcanedomain.com/">Noah Mendelsohn</a>. I also took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/160-2013f">Algorithms</a>. I also participated in my first <a href="http://blog.echonest.com/post/66776489063/the-echo-nests-5th-music-hack-day-boston-was-a-roaring">Hackathon</a>, in which my project, <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/music-hack-day-boston-2013/hacks/echoes">Echoes</a> won a prize for best use of the EchoNest api. 
        In the second semester of sophomore year, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105">
            Programming Languages</a>, for which I am currently a teaching assistant. This class introduced me to functional programming, a topic which fascinates me to this day. 
        I also took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/23">Game Development</a>.
