Personal Website

I have correctly implemented everything that I know of. I've discussed the assignment with Tyler Lubeck and Connor Taylor. I've spent somewhere between 5 and 10 hours on this assignment. 

This website is adapted from my personal website from the summer. There are several pages not specified in the assignment which came from the previous version.
