I started at age 11 with basic forays into web development; I learned the basics of HTML from my father and put together some basic websites locally using OpenOffice. 
At age 12, I took my first step into imperative programming with 
<a href=http://www.thegamecreators.com/?m=view_product&id=2030&page=index>Dark Basic Classic</a>, then called Dark Basic. 
The simple, readable syntax was enough to set me off developing games, a hobby that I have continued to this day. 
By seventh grade, I had intuited the standard "game loop" design framework, and 
used it to develop several fledgling projects in the newer Dark Basic Pro. I rarely delved deeply into projects, preferring to experiment
with new ideas instead of developing old ones.

As I entered High School, I began to develop networked multiplayer games to play with my friends on the school's LAN.

Sophomore year, I began taking classes in Computer Programming, and was introduced to my first Object-Oriented Language, Java.

As a senior in high school, I embarked on a guided study on iOS development.

First semester of freshman year, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/15/">Data Structures</a>, and learned C++ in the process. 
The next semester, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40">Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming</a>, a class for which I am now a Teaching Assistant. I also took Discrete Mathematics.

As a first-semester sophomore, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150IDS">Internet Scale Distributed Systems</a>, a special topics course taught by the IETF's own 
<a href="http://www.arcanedomain.com">Noah Mendelsohn</a>. I also took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/160-2013f">Algorithms</a>. 
In the second semester of sophomore year, I took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105">
Programming Languages</a>. This class introduced me to functional programming, a topic which fascinates me to this day. 
I also took <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/23">Game Development</a>.
