I'm Arthur Berman, a Junior at Tufts University. I expect to graduate in May 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

<h3> Progamming Experience</h3>
<p>
I've been programming in some way or other for 9 years, and have been actively studying programming in an academic environment for 5 years. 
I started at age 11 with basic forays into web development; I learned the basics of HTML from my father and put together some basic websites locally using OpenOffice. 
At age 12, I took my first step into imperative programming with 
<a href=http://www.thegamecreators.com/?m=view_product&id=2030&page=index>Dark Basic Classic</a>, then called Dark Basic. 
The simple, readable syntax was enough to set me off developing games, a hobby that I have continued to this day. 
By seventh grade, I had intuited the standard "game loop" design framework, and 
used it to develop several fledgling projects in the newer Dark Basic Pro. I rarely delved deeply into projects, preferring to experiment
with new ideas instead of developing old ones.

As I entered High School, I began to develop networked multiplayer games to play with my friends on the school's LAN. 
</p><p>
Sophomore year, I began taking classes in Computer Programming, and was introduced to my first Object-Oriented Language, Java. 
</p><p>
As a senior in high school, I embarked on a guided study on iOS development.
