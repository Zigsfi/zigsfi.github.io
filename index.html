<p>
I'm Arthur Berman, a Junior at Tufts University. I expect to graduate in May 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
</p>
<p>
I've been programming in some way or other for 
<a href="/history.html">9 years</a>, and have been actively studying 
programming in an academic environment for <a href="/history.html#academic">5 years</a>. 
</p>

<p>I enjoy tinkering with software and experimenting with novel approaches
to development. I love learning new languages and exploring new paradigms;
recently I have been focusing on functional languages and languages with little
to no imperative functionality. Currently, I am revisiting one of my favorite
class projects, the <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40/homework/um.pdf">
Comp 40 Universal Machine</a>, in languages besides C. I am currently developing
a Haskell implementation and a Scheme implementation. 
</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, rock climbing, sailing, and playing video games. </p>
